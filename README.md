## 💡 Important Note

[Althought it might look like I coded the extra projects myself, I used a lot of existing code, tutorials, and open source projects as guide to complete them.
The goal was to learn, not to take credit or to make the impression i'm a coding prodigy. I'm still very much a beginner and have a lot more to learn!]
